# Face Mask detection 

 
in this project : deep learning architecture first detects the face and then based on facial features it identifies either a person is wearing

mask or not , in case if a person is not wearing the mask it can also generate
an alarm correspondingly .in  this deep learning architecture 

no matter which race you belong to or which age you belong to it works for all of them perfectly .

- in this project i used Python for programming .
- for  face mask detection i used  transfer learning. 
-to draw the rectangles and text data and identification of this face i used  opencv .
- and for classification of this face mask i used  tensorflow deep learning library.

## Dataset 

I used 2 datasets one contains peoplw wearing a mask "images with Correctly Masked Face Dataset (CMFD) ":https://esigelec-my.sharepoint.com/personal/cabani_esigelec_fr/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?ga=1&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fcabani%5Fesigelec%5Ffr%2FDocuments%2FMaskedFaceNetDataset%2FCMFD%2F00000 
 
  The other dataset contains images for people without a mask "Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset (FFHQ)" : https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset 



# Running the codes on your local Jupyter Notebook
Download the files with:

1- git clone https://github.com/Eman-Alshaikh/Mask-detection.git
Then, you can install all the packages used in this project with:

2- pip install -r requirements.txt

3- run the file make_detection.py to show the result.


# improvements in the future 


apply this project on real time video .
